Lab 1: Getting started with Python
==========================
{: .primer-spec-toc-ignore }

This lab is intended to provide a starting point for the Python development within this course, and is designed to be approachable from any experience level.

## Setup


## Coding
First, import the `numpy` library. We can optionally rename this library for ease of use within the scope of this program with the `as` keyword.

```
import numpy as np
```

To import a text file, we can simply use the built-in `open` function.

```
f = open("numbers.txt", "r")
```
