Setup up VS Code for Python
==========================
{: .primer-spec-toc-ignore }

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a lightweight, easy-to-use, source code editor with debugging support.  It runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux (including CAEN Linux).  Visual Studio Code is not the same program as Visual Studio.

If you already have VS Code installed with the Python extension, skip to the [Create a project](#create-a-project) section.
</div>

## Prerequisites
VS Code relies on external command line tools.  If you haven't installed CLI tools on your machine yet, follow one of these tutorials first.

| [macOS](setup_macos.html)| [Windows](setup_wsl.html) | [Linux](setup_wsl.html#install-cli-tools)

Next, follow our [Command line interface (CLI)](cli.html) tutorial.

## Install
Choose your platform below. Be sure to install the relevant extensions.

### Linux
Install the .deb package at [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux).

### CAEN Linux
VS Code is already installed on CAEN Linux desktop environment.  You can use it while sitting at a CAEN Linux computer, or through a [VNC connection to CAEN Linux](https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/76/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=4999).

### macOS
Make sure you have macOS 11.1 or later.
```console
$ sw_vers
ProductName:	macOS
ProductVersion:	11.7
```

Use the homebrew package manager to install VS Code. You can run this command from any directory.
```console
$ brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

### Windows
Make sure you have updated Windows and WSL installations according to the [WSL tutorial](setup_wsl.html).

Then, Install VS Code from the web [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Select "Add to PATH".

Reboot.  Open a terminal again (WSL/Ubuntu) and verify your installation.  Your version might be different.

```console
$ code --version
1.74.1
1ad8d514439d5077d2b0b7ee64d2ce82a9308e5a
x64
```

### Extensions
Make sure VS Code is installed correctly by checking the version.  You need version 1.52.1 or higher.
```console
$ code --version
1.52.1
```

Install the VS Code [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).
```console
$ code --install-extension ms-vscode.cpptools
```

Verify that the extension is installed.  It's OK if you have other extensions installed.
```console
$ code --list-extensions
ms-python.python
```

## Create a project
<div class="primer-spec-callout info" markdown="1">
If you plan to access course resources from multiple machines this semester, you may wish to do your development work on a remote server rather than a local machine. Learn about how to access U-M servers remotely via VS Code in the [Remote Development](setup_remote.html) tutorial.
</div>

To create a VS Code project, create a folder (directory).  There are many ways to create folders: Finder/File Explorer, the VS Code interface, VS Code integrated terminal, and the system terminal.  We'll use the system terminal and call our example project `p1-stats`.

**macOS:** Open the Terminal application.

**Windows/WSL:** Open the Ubuntu application.

Navigate to the directory where you store your projects, create a new directory, then move into the new directory. Your folder location might be different.  Here's some help with [`cd`](cli.html#cd), the [tilde `~`](cli.html#home-directory-), and [`mkdir`](cli.html#mkdir).
```console
$ mkdir ~/eecs298
$ cd ~/eecs298
$ mkdir lab1
$ cd lab1
```

<div class="primer-spec-callout warning" markdown="1">
**Pitfall:** Avoid paths that contain spaces.  Spaces causes problems with some command line tools.

| Bad Example     | Good Example   |
|-----------------|----------------|
| `EECS 298/` | `eecs298/` |
| `Lab 1/` | `lab1/` |

</div>

Start VS Code and open your project folder by selecting `File` > `Open Folder...` > navigate to your home folder.

<div class="primer-spec-callout info" markdown="1">
**Pro-tip:** Here's a quick way to open VS Code to a specific project folder from the command line.  First make sure you're in the directory that contains your source code.
```console
$ ls
main.py ...
$ code .
```
</div>

### Add new files
Select the add file icon and give it a name, e.g., `lab1.py`.

Alternatively, create your `lab1.py` file from the command line using [`touch`](cli.html#touch).

```console
$ touch main.cpp
```
You can find the built-in VS Code terminal at the bottom of the window. If there if no terminal open, start one by selecting `Terminal` > `New Terminal` and navigating to the correct location via the command line.

## Run
Use the terminal to navigate to the folder containing the Python file you wish to run. Run the file by using `python3`.

```console
$ python3 main.py
```

You can also interface with the Python interpreter interactively within

```console
$ python3
```

This will launch the Python interpreter within your terminal, which you can use to test lines of Python code. To exit the Python interpreter, use

```console
$ exit()
```
